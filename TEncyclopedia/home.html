Headquarters are in Munich It originated in 1916 as Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke, a builder of aircraft engines, but assumed the name Bayerische Motoren Werke in July 1917 and began producing motorcycles in the 1920s. BMW entered the automobile business in 1928. The company’s R32 motorcycle set a world speed record that was not broken until 1937. During World War II BMW built the world’s first jet airplane engines, used by the Luftwaffe, Germany’s air force. After the war the company tried to move into the small-car market but found that it could not compete effectively against Volkswagen’s compact, inexpensive autos. By 1959 the company was on the verge of bankruptcy, and its managers were planning to sell the firm to Daimler-Benz.";
                case 2:
                    return "Gottlieb Daimler is born on 17 March 1834 in Schorndorf. After training as a gunsmith and working in France, he attends the Polytechnic School in Stuttgart from 1857 to 1859. After completing various technical activities in France and England, he starts work as a draftsman in Geislingen in 1862. At the end of 1863, he is appointed workshop inspector in a machine tool factory in Reutlingen, where he meets Wilhelm Maybach in 1865. In 1872, he becomes Technical Director of the gas engine manufacturer Deutz Gasmotorenfabrik, where he becomes familiar with Otto’s four-stroke technology. After differences with the Managing Director, he leaves the company in 1882. Daimler sets up a development workshop in his greenhouse at his Cannstatt villa to concentrate on developing petrol-driven four-stroke engines. Working with Wilhelm Maybach in 1884, he develops an internal combustion engine known today as the 'Grandfather Clock'. With its compact, low-weight design, the machine forms the basis for installation in a vehicle. The costs of trial operations soon consume Daimler’s entire fortune, however, so he is obliged to find business partners. He founds 'Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft' on 28 November 1890 together with Max Duttenhofer and his business partner Wilhelm Lorenz. But while Duttenhofer wants to produce stationary engines, Daimler prefers to focus on vehicle production, and a dispute ensues.";
                case 3:
                    return "The history of the Volkswagen brand began with the “Käfer”; development work on this Nazi prestige project began in 1934. On May 28, 1937, the “Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH“ (Company for the Preparation of the German Volkswagen Ltd.) was formally established. The name was changed to “Volkswagenwerk GmbH” in 1938, and the company built its main plant in what has become Wolfsburg. However, the outbreak of war and integration in the arms industry prevented mass production of the Volkswagen “people’s car”  instead, military vehicles and other armaments were produced using forced labor.After the war, the British instructed Volkswagen to build the Volkswagen saloon at the end of 1945. With the Type 1 (Käfer) model, and the Type 2 (Transporter) model added in 1950, Volkswagen became a symbol of Germany’s economic miracle, above all as a result of the strong export orientation on the part of the company converted into a joint stock corporation in 1960. Innovative and flexible manufacturing systems made an appearance in the 1970s and led to the birth of a new generation of Volkswagens with the Passat, Scirocco, Golf and Polo models. Growth was boosted in the 1980s through advances in vehicle technology, flexible production, and forward-looking international cooperation.As its globalization advances, Volkswagen is emerging as one of the world’s most successful volume car manufacturers, and today offers cutting-edge solutions for future issues such as e-mobility and digitalization.";
